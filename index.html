                <p>In this section, you will find an overview of my thesis work, which delves into the intricacies of <span class="thesis-title">Map-Matching for Train localisation</span>. My research focuses on the concept of <span class="thesis-keyword">Digital Maps</span>, aiming to being able to locate the trai with just <span class="thesis-keyword">Onboard Sensors</span>.
                </p>
                <p>Eventhough my journey through the PhD has just started, the months of extended research have veen fruitful. I have researched extensively the state-of-the-art approaches of map-matching for train localisation, and have managed to write a scientific paper, eventhough this has not been published yet. Hereunder I present the abstract of my recent work:</p>
                <p class="thesis-abstract"><p>Precise localisation of rail vehicles is a key element towards the development and deployment of novel train control systems. Localisation of trains can be considered as a 1-D positioning problem, as trains only move on tracks, easing the localisation approach. 
                </p>
                <p>Localisation with maps makes a great choice as the maps describe unambiguously train tracks, easing the train localisation and making it an effective choice. On top of that, train localisation with a map requires just onboard sensors making it a low-cost alternative to localisation with track-side equipment, as this equipment makes train positioning costs increase with the reach of the use. 
                </p>
                <p>Even though this topic has been widely studied in the literature, there has not been a classification of the used methodologies for map-matching for train positioning. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to make a classification of the used map-matching algorithms for train localisation. On top of that, this paper also discusses how to build a digital map from a set of coordinates.

                <p>Welcome to my biography section! Here, you can learn more about my background, education, and the journey that has shaped who I am today.</p>
                <p>I was born and raised in Donosti, where I developed a keen interest in maps from a young age. My curiosity and passion for mathematics and its importance on the real world led me to pursue a degree in Industrial Engineering from Bilbao School of Engineering. During my time at university, I had the opportunity to work on various projects and collaborate with esteemed professionals, which significantly enriched my knowledge and experience. </p>
                <p>After completing my undergraduate studies, I furthered my academic journey by obtaining a Master’s degree in Industrial Engineering specialized in automation, electronics and robotics,  from Bilbao School of Engineering. During my time in the master's program, I had the opportunity to delve deeper into software development and deep learning and work on advanced projects.</p>
                <p>After graduating, I was granted an internship in a peruvian business as a softwware developer, where I have worked on numerous exciting and challenging projects. The internship has allowed me to grow both personally and professionally.</p>
                <p>Thank you for taking the time to read my biography. I hope it gives you a better understanding of my journey and the experiences that have shaped my path.</p>
